Some of the art in Cinderella's Castle was made using 14 karat gold
While there are many American flags in Main Street USA, only the one in the central flagpole is real. The rest miss some stars/stripes so they do not have to be taken down every night as the US Flag Code advises.
Cast members (Disney employees) get around the park via a massive system of underground tunnels with exits in each land.
There is a special suite inside Cinderella's Castle that you can only stay in via a competition held by Disney.
There are bins every 30 steps in the park as Walt himself found that guests were willing to walk 30 steps before considering littering
While Magic Kingdom is massive (at 107 acres) it's smaller than the Animal Kingdom parking lot!

This is the only park in WDW to have an inversion on a coaster (on the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith).
Though it is no longer there, the mascot of the park used to be a giant sorcer Mickey hat.
Hollywood Studios was almost merely a pavillion at Epcot but then CEO Michael Eisner decided that there should be an entire park dedicated to the theme.
The park was originally named Disney's MGM Studios and had a working animation studio that made and produced several classic Disney films, incluiding Lilo & Stitch.
While hidden Mickeys are common across all Disney parks, Hollywood Studios is home to one of the largest that can only be seen from the sky.
Hollywood Studios is the only place you can find Audrey Hepburn's handprints! Grauman's Chinese Theater had never asked her for them and when they realised this oversight and reached out to her to rectify it she declined.
The All-New Mickey Mouse Club was filmed in the park featuring stars such as Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling and Britney Spears.

There was originally supposed to be a ride about unicorns and another about dragons in the parks, hence why you can see unicorns and dragons on some sinage around the park.

Expedition Everest is one of the most expensive roller coasters ever made, partly due to the nearly 200ft mountain that houses the coaster.
The savannah on the Kilimanjaro Safari is bigger than the entire Magic Kingdom park.
