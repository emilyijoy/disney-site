Some of the art in Cinderella's Castle was made using 14 karat gold
While there are many American flags in Main Street USA, only the one in the central flagpole is real. The rest miss some stars/stripes so they do not have to be taken down every night as the US Flag Code advises.
Cast members (Disney employees) get around the park via a massive system of underground tunnels with exits in each land.
There is a special suite inside Cinderella's Castle that you can only stay in via a competition held by Disney.
There are bins every 30 steps in the park as Walt himself found that guests were willing to walk 30 steps before considering littering
While Magic Kingdom is massive (at 107 acres) it's smaller than the Animal Kingdom parking lot!
Forced perspective is used a lot in the parks to make things appear larger than they are, one use of this is Beast's castle in Fantasyland.
