            <h3>Hollywood Studios was opened in May 1989, Hollywood Studios was originally intended to be the place where guests can ride the movies. While that aim of the park is sadly gone (rip Studio Backlot Tour and Streets of America) Imagineers continue to design incredible rides for the park, including those in the recently opened Toy Story Land and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. </h3>

                    <li>Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith</li>
                        <p>How about some backstage passes? <br> This is, in my opinion, the best ride in the entirety of the Walt Disney World Resort. The ride is a classic but not one that is boring to re-ride, but one that is exciting every single time. The concept of racing to a concert is great and the music? Amazing! The fact that each car plays different songs adds to the re-rideability as you never know which songs you'll get. While it does not have the outdoor aspects that provide and amazing view like the rollercoasters in the other parks, it is the only ride to go upside down. It is also incredibly fast and always provides a thrilling experience. </p>
                    <li>Rise of the Resistance</li>
                        <p>Listen, I'm not really a massive Star Wars fan... I watched them as a kid and I've seen 2/3 of the new ones but this ride is incredible. While there are no 'thrills' in the physical sense as the rie is a trackless car so does'nt go upside down etc., as an attraction is it breathtaking. The experience feels lifelike with seemless animatronics and appearances from Star Wars characters guiding you though your journey.</p>
                    <li>Toy Story Mania</li>
                        <p>While maybe not as 'exciting' as some other entries on this list, Toy Story Mania is a solid addition to the park and provides for some family-friendly fun. As it's incredibly interactive, it's easy to go on this ride multiple times and still get the same level of enjoyment.</p>
