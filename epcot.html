            <h3>EPCOT was opened in October 1982. Originally planned by Walt as the 'Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow', a city where people would work and live, after his death the Disney company decided to make it solely theme park. The park is made up of multiple areas that showcase the world and man's creations, including the World Showcase, a collection of 11 areas all dedicated to a different nation.</h3>

                    <li>Test Track</li>
                        <p>This fast-paced ride allows you to design a car before taking it for a test drive. It tests your designs based on capability, efficiency, responsiveness and finally speed, where the car hurtles above the park at 65 mph. The creativity in designing the car combined with the thrilling experience it provides is why Test Track is by far the best ride in the park. </p>
                    <li>Soarin' Around the World</li>
                        <p>Take a trip around the world before coming back to sunny Florida in Soarin'. A family-friendly experience, this handgliding-esque motion simulator experience shows off the wonders of the world. This ride is incredibly due to the scale and how immersive the experience feels as they even spray sents to match what you're seeing.</p>
                    <li>The Seas with Nemo &amp Friends</li>
                        <p>Sharkbait hoo ha ha <br> This gentle ride will take you through Marlin's treacherous journey to find his son. While I am very afraid of Bruce and the ride is quite slow, it's a lovely addition to the park and the way they project the chracters into the real aquarium is very cool.</p>
